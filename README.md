## Getting Started

### Why this project?

This project aims to provide a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. It is designed for learners and practitioners who want to explore the CIFAR-10 dataset and gain experience in building and training deep learning models. By working through this project, users can deepen their understanding of neural network architecture, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (depending on your implementation)
- `jupyter`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-cifar10-classifier.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cnn-cifar10-classifier
   ```
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and run the `CNN_cifar10.ipynb` file.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

You can load the dataset directly using TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries.
