# CNN CIFAR-10 Classifier

A Python implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project includes data preprocessing, a custom CNN architecture, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.
# CNN_CIFAR10

## Features
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Implementation:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Loss

## Files in the Repository
- **`CNN_cifar10.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the CNN model, data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CNN_CIFAR10.git
    cd CNN_CIFAR10
    ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook CNN_cifar10.ipynb
    ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, build and train the CNN, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model implemented in this project consists of:
- Convolutional Layers
- Max Pooling Layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Fully Connected (Dense) Layers

## Results
- Training and test accuracy: Reported in the notebook.
- Loss plots: Visualized during the training process.
