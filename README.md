# CNN CIFAR-10 Classifier

A Python implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project includes data preprocessing, a custom CNN architecture, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.

## Features

- CIFAR-10 dataset preprocessing and exploration.
- Custom CNN architecture implementation.
- Model training with real-time loss and accuracy visualization.
- Evaluation of model performance on test data.
- Visualization of predictions and misclassifications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (depending on your implementation)
- `jupyter`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-cifar10-classifier.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cnn-cifar10-classifier
   ```
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and run the `CNN_cifar10.ipynb` file.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

You can load the dataset directly using TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries.

## Results

- **Training Accuracy:** Add final accuracy here.
- **Test Accuracy:** Add final accuracy here.
- **Sample Predictions:** Add examples of predictions with images and labels.

Include training/validation loss and accuracy graphs for better visualization.
